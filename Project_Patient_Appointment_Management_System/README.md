# Appointment Management System

This is a simple ** console** for managing appointments.  
It allows you to:

- Add new appointments (patient name, date, time).
- View all scheduled appointments.
- Delete existing appointments.

The project is divided into multiple files for clarity:
- **main.py** -> Runs the main menu of the program.
- **services.py** -> Contains functions for adding, showing, and deleting appointments.
- **storage.py** -> Stores the list of appointments.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed 
2. Clone or download the project files.
3. Open a terminal in the project folder.
4. Run the program with:


python main.py
